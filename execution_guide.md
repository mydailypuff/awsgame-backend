# How to Execute Changes in AWS Lambda with Bedrock

To execute the changes you've made to your AWS Lambda function that uses Bedrock, follow these steps:

1. **Package Your Code**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Create a deployment package
   zip -r deployment.zip .
   ```

2. **Deploy to AWS Lambda**
   You have several options:

   a. Using AWS Console:
   - Navigate to AWS Lambda Console
   - Select your function
   - Upload the deployment.zip file in the "Code" tab

   b. Using AWS CLI:
   ```bash
   aws lambda update-function-code \
       --function-name YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME \
       --zip-file fileb://deployment.zip
   ```

   c. Using Infrastructure as Code (recommended):
   - Update your CloudFormation/Terraform/SAM template
   - Deploy using your IaC tool of choice

3. **Test Your Changes**
   - Use the AWS Lambda Console's test feature
   - Use the AWS CLI:
   ```bash
   aws lambda invoke \
       --function-name YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME \
       --payload '{"key": "value"}' \
       response.json
   ```

4. **Monitor Your Changes**
   - Check CloudWatch Logs
   - Monitor metrics in CloudWatch
   - Review any errors in the Lambda console

5. **Bedrock Specific Considerations**
   - Ensure your Lambda function has proper IAM permissions for Bedrock
   - Verify Bedrock service quotas and limits
   - Test your changes in a development/staging environment first

Remember to:
- Always test in a non-production environment first
- Follow your organization's deployment procedures
- Keep track of deployments in case you need to rollback
- Monitor costs and performance after deployment
