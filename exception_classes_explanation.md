## Exception Classes Implementation Pattern

In the `custom_exceptions.py` file, you'll notice that some exception classes like `AgentConfigurationError` and `AgentValidationError` appear empty, containing only docstrings. This is a valid and common pattern in Python for the following reasons:

1. **Inheritance**: These classes inherit from `AgentError`, which already implements the core functionality needed (message handling and initialization).

2. **Type Distinction**: The empty classes serve as distinct types for error handling, allowing code to catch specific types of errors:
   ```python
   try:
       # some code
   except AgentConfigurationError:
       # handle configuration errors specifically
   except AgentValidationError:
       # handle validation errors specifically
   ```

3. **Documentation**: The docstrings provide clear information about when these exceptions should be used.

4. **Best Practice**: This follows the principle of having specific exception types for different error scenarios, making error handling more precise and maintainable.

Unless these exception classes need additional attributes or methods beyond what `AgentError` provides, leaving them as empty classes with just docstrings is completely fine and follows good Python practices.
